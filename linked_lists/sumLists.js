/* You have 2 numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1s
digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers
and returns the sum as a linked list.

Ex:
Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2) ==> 617 + 295
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9 ==> 912

What if the digits are stored in forward order? */
